Zoom-QuickLanch
This project came from not wanting to have to search for the zoom link and password everytime I wanted to jion a class.
So i built this, now I only have to add a link and the corresponding password once in the program and then I can use it 
to join meetings without even having to click a link or enter a password!

Required:
    Having Windows terminal installed
    Accepting downloads when running the install.bat file

    
To install simply place the folder where you want to store it, the folder must be a read/write for example, use the user folder.
Then run the batch file and then open your Windows terminal and press "Ctrl+Shift+1" to run the program.
Then you can add the links and passwords you want from the windows terminal!
